Description:

This repository contains source code, implementing a methodical
approach to data gathering, data quality and tidiness assessment
and subsequent data cleaning and analysis on a dataset of the past
tweet archive of the [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) 
account. 

Robust and repeatable data gathering approach from 3 dfferent
 sources were implemented via extracting data from local files
 , cloud repositories and API endpoints using programmatic means
 . Gathered data was subsequently wrangled and cleaned to address
  data quality and tidiness issues raised during exploration
  . Finally, some insightful assessments were made on the cleaned
   data.
