Description:

In this project, descriptive statistical analysis has been 
performed on data provided by [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).
The dataset consists of physicochemical properties 
and quality ratings of red and white wine samples. A rigorous 
descriptive statistical analysis has been performed to answer 
pertinent questions related to the correlation of wine 
physicochemical properties and quality ratings. The dataset has 
been attached in the repository as csv files.
