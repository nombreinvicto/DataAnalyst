Description:

In this project, descriptive statistical analysis has been 
performed on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/).
Motivate is a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the
US.The data can be used to uncover bike share usage patterns. In the 
analysis, 2017 bike share usage patterns for the first six months 
of the cities of Chicago, New York and Washington can be analysed.
 The attached `bikeshare.py` file can be run using any Python3 
 interpreter and the user will be interactively guided through in 
 the terminal for any relevant user queries presented in the 
 console. The data pertaining to the cities of Chicago, New York 
 and Washington is attached in the repository as csv files.
