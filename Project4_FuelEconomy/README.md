Description:

In this project, descriptive statistical analysis has 
been performed on data provided by [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy).
The data comprises of automobile brand features (like fuel economy,
engine specs, mileage and so on) over 2 different fiscal years 
2008 and 2018. A simpler version of the data has been attached in 
this repository as csv files.

A rigorous descriptive statistical analysis has been performed to 
answer pertinent questions related to the evolution of automobile 
fuel economy, mileage etc over the years. This analysis involves 
the analysis of raw data and hence includes a lengthy 
treatment of data wrangling and cleaning prior to the actual analysis.
